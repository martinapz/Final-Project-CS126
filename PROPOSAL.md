Put your final project proposal here.

    
For my final project, I would like to create the PacMan game using Cinder. 
PacMan is a traditional video game, and I think it would be very interesting to 
design the implementation and GUI for the game, as well as potentially add more 
features by taking advantage of Cinders functionalities. 

The timeline for the project is as follows...

1. Week 1 : Implement the logic for the PacMan game. This includes creating structures 
to handle the implementation, as well as focusing on object decomposition. This week 
will focus on creating the basic structure for the game. 


 2. Week 2: Implement the computer strategy for the game. How the computer can maximize 
the most amount of points when playing against the user. Additionally, if possible, I would 
like to start with the graphics for game. 


3. Week 3: 
Setting up the graphics of the application using cinder. I would create the
GUI for the application. I would also design and create the elements of the game (e.g
Pacman, walls, point tracker etc.), as well as add user functionality.


4. Stretch goals: 
If possible, I would like to add multiple "levels" to the game, which would include 
new layout for the player. This would also involve possibly tweaking the computer 
strategy for the game. Additionally, I could add more details such as sounds to 
improve user experience.
