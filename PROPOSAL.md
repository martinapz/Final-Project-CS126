Put your final project proposal here.

    
For my final project, I would like to create the PacMan game using Cinder. 
PacMan is a traditional video game, and I think it would be very interesting to 
design the implementation and GUI for the game, as well as potentially add more 
features by taking advantage of Cinders functionalities. 

The timeline for the project is as follows...

1. Week 1 : Work on the Cinder and GUI aspects of the project. This includes implementing Cinder
fucntions to display the Pacman board. Additionally, upload a text file that reads the board for
the game and be able to read that file.    


 2. Week 2: Implement the logic behind the game. I will focus on implementing the movement of 
the Pacman. I also want to work on updating the score everytime the Pacman eats a coin, display 
this score for the user to see, and set that tile to empty once the coin has been eaten. I will 
also work on changing the direction of the pacman depending on what key the user presses, and checking
to see if that direction is valid before moving. If possible, I will start working on the ghost movements.     


3. Week 3: 
This week I will work on the ghost movements around the board. The ghosts will move randomly.
Additionally, I will implement the logic for the immunity tiles
which means that the pacman does not need to worry about the ghost trying to eat it. 


4. Stretch goals: 
If possible, I would like to add a start screen for the user. I would also like to add multiple
"levels" to the game, which would include new layout for the player. Additionally, I could add
more details such as sounds to improve user experience.
